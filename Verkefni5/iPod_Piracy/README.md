This Python3 application will copy music files from iPod's hard drive into a target directory.
To run the application do the following:
./copy_mp3.py -i ipod_directory -o target_output_file
The -i (or --input) is the source of the ipod directory and the -o (or --ouput) is the desired non existing output file, where the songs are copied over.
